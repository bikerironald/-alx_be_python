# Objective: Deepen your understanding of inheritance and composition in Python by creating a system that models a library with different types of books.

# Task Description:
# Develop two Python scripts: library_system.py and main.py. In library_system.py, youâ€™ll define a base class Book and two derived classes, EBook and PrintBook, showcasing inheritance. Additionally, implement a Library class demonstrating composition by managing a collection of books.

# library_system.py:
# Base Class - Book:

# Attributes: title (str) and author (str).
# Method: __init__(self, title, author) for initializing book attributes.
# Derived Classes - EBook and PrintBook:

# Both classes inherit from Book.
# EBook additional attribute: file_size (int).
# PrintBook additional attribute: page_count (int).
# Each derived class should have its own __init__ method that properly calls the base class __init__ while also initializing its unique attribute.
# Composition - Library:

# Attributes: books (a list to store instances of Book, EBook, and PrintBook).
# Methods:
# add_book(self, book): Adds a Book, EBook, or PrintBook instance to the library.
# list_books(self): Prints details of each book in the library.
# main.py (Provided for Testing):
# This script tests the functionality of your classes in library_system.py by adding different types of books to a Library instance and listing them.

# from library_system import Book, EBook, PrintBook, Library

# def main():
#     # Create a Library instance
#     my_library = Library()

#     # Create instances of each type of book
#     classic_book = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")
#     digital_novel = EBook("Snow Crash", "Neal Stephenson", 500)
#     paper_novel = PrintBook("The Catcher in the Rye", "J.D. Salinger", 234)

#     # Add books to the library
#     my_library.add_book(classic_book)
#     my_library.add_book(digital_novel)
#     my_library.add_book(paper_novel)

#     # List all books in the library
#     my_library.list_books()

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# Expected Output:
# Your output should list the details of each book added to the library, reflecting the specific attributes of EBook and PrintBook, as well as the common attributes inherited from Book.

# Book: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
# EBook: Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, File Size: 500KB
# PrintBook: The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, Page Count: 234
